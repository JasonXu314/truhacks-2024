<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Inspiration
Driven by a team member's powerful story as a first-generation immigrant, who achieved success through education, we're passionate about making learning accessible to all. Their journey underscores our belief that education is a fundamental human right, not a privilege.

Furthermore, our experience as tutors highlighted the limitations of existing tutoring platforms. College software is often clunky and uninviting, while popular video conferencing tools like Zoom can become expensive for extended sessions. These hurdles prevent students from receiving the ongoing support they need.

That's why we built a free, full-stack web application that removes these barriers. Our streamlined design keeps students engaged, while built-in live, one-on-one video calls with tutors allow for in-depth explanations.  To maximize interactivity and collaboration, we've also incorporated a virtual whiteboard with various colored pens.

## What it does
Our live and interactive platform empowers students to connect with tutors for personalized learning. Through our intuitive web application, students can easily create accounts and access their dedicated "Student Hub." Here, they can write their questions, choose a subject, and submit them directly to qualified tutors. Tutors, using their own dashboards, can review student requests and choose to accept.

Recognizing the value of face-to-face interaction, we've integrated live video calls into every session. To further enhance collaboration and explanation, students and tutors can utilize a real-time whiteboard with multiple colored pens. Committed to equitable access to education, we offer unlimited session lengths and avoid hidden fees. We believe quality learning should be available to everyone, everywhere.
